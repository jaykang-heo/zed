## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The "Review Diff" button in the git diff view now only appears when there are actual file changes to review, not just when AI is enabled. This prevents showing the button on empty diffs.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/git/project-diff.md
- **Section**: "AI Review" or existing AI-related section (if file exists)
- **Change**: Update existing description or add note if missing
- **Target keyword**: git diff review
- **Frontmatter**: 
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Review Git Changes in Zed
  description: Use AI-powered review to analyze uncommitted changes and generate commit messages
  ---
  ```
- **Links**: 
  - [Settings Editor](/settings/settings-editor)
  - [AI Assistant](/assistant/overview)
  - [Keybindings](/customization/keybindings)
  - Marketing link: [Zed AI Features](https://zed.dev/ai)
- **Suggestion**: 

> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

When viewing uncommitted changes in the project diff panel, you can request an AI-powered review by clicking the "Review Diff" button. This button appears in the toolbar when:

- Your diff contains file changes
- The AI assistant is enabled in your settings

If your diff is empty, the review button is hidden since there are no changes to analyze.

To enable AI features, open the Settings Editor ({#kb zed::OpenSettings}) and turn on the **AI Assistant** option, or add to your settings:

```json
{
  "agent": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. If creating a new file, ensure all sections follow voice guidelines. If updating existing file, review entire content for hedging words ("simply", "just"), passive voice, and vague claims.

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 5/5   | Concrete conditions listed, specific setting path |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5/5   | Direct statements, active voice throughout |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5/5   | States facts without hedging or hype |
  | Developer Respect    | 5/5   | Explains behavior, provides both UI and JSON paths |
  | Information Priority | 4/5   | Leads with what changed, context follows |
  | Specificity          | 5/5   | Exact button name, precise conditions, setting name |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5/5   | Matches second-person present pattern |
  | Earned Claims        | 5/5   | No claims, only documented behavior |
  | **TOTAL**            | 39/40 |       |

  Pass threshold: all criteria 4+. ✓

### Notes for Reviewer
This assumes `docs/src/git/project-diff.md` exists covering the git diff UI. If the git documentation uses a different structure or file name, the suggestion should be adapted to the existing location where AI review features are documented. If no such documentation exists yet, this may need to be deferred or the file created as part of broader git UI documentation.
