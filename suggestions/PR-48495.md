_PR: https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/48495_

## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
This change adds support for the global `disable_ai` setting to stop and prevent the Copilot server from starting when AI features are disabled. This is a behavior modification that affects how the existing `disable_ai` setting interacts with Copilot.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/assistant/copilot.md
- **Section**: Existing section about disabling Copilot (or new "Disabling Copilot" section if one doesn't exist)
- **Change**: Update/Add
- **Target keyword**: disable GitHub Copilot in Zed
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: GitHub Copilot in Zed
  description: Configure and use GitHub Copilot for code completions and inline suggestions in Zed.

  ```

  - [AI settings reference](/assistant/configuration)
  - [GitHub Copilot on zed.dev](https://zed.dev/features#copilot)
- **Suggestion**: 

> **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

To disable GitHub Copilot, set `disable_ai` to `true` in your settings. When enabled, this setting stops any running Copilot server and prevents it from starting:

In the Settings Editor, search for "disable ai" and enable the toggle.

Alternatively, add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "disable_ai": true
}
```

The Copilot server will stop immediately when you enable this setting. Re-enable AI features by setting `disable_ai` to `false` (or removing the setting).

  | Developer Respect    | 5     | Shows both UI and JSON paths, respects user choice |
  | Information Priority | 5     | Setting first, behavior second, mechanism last |
  | Specificity          | 5     | Exact setting name, specific outcomes |
  | Voice Consistency    | 4     | Maintains docs voice throughout |
  | Earned Claims        | 5     | No unearned superlatives |
  | **TOTAL**            | 37/40 |       |

  Pass threshold: all criteria 4+. ✓

### Notes for Reviewer
- The code change is a behavioral modification to an existing setting (`disable_ai`), not a new feature
- Previously, `disable_ai` may not have fully stopped the Copilot server; this change ensures it does
- The "Changed in Preview" callout is appropriate since this modifies existing behavior
- If a "Disabling Copilot" section doesn't exist in the Copilot docs, this would warrant creating one
- Consider checking if `disable_ai` is documented elsewhere in the AI/assistant docs and ensuring consistency
