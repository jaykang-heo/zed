## Documentation Suggestions

### Summary
The code changes add conditional control over when the welcome page displays in empty panes. Previously, the welcome page appeared in any empty pane; now it only appears in panes where `should_display_welcome_page` is explicitly enabled (currently only the center pane in workspaces). This is a behavior modification that affects when users see the welcome page.

### Suggested Changes

#### 1. docs/src/getting-started.md
- **Section**: Existing "Welcome Page" or "First Launch" section (if one exists; otherwise create a new section under an appropriate heading)
- **Change**: Update
- **Target keyword**: Zed welcome page
- **Frontmatter**:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Getting Started with Zed
  description: Learn how to navigate Zed's interface, open projects, and customize your editor setup.

  - [Configuring settings](/docs/configuring-zed)
  - [Keyboard shortcuts](/docs/key-bindings)

- **Suggestion**: 
  
  Add or update the welcome page section to clarify when users see it:

  > **Changed in Preview (v0.225).** See [release notes](/releases#0.225).

  When you open Zed without a folder, you see the welcome page in the main editor area. The welcome page offers quick actions to open a folder, clone a repository, or view documentation. Once you open a folder or file, the welcome page disappears. If you split the editor into multiple panes, the welcome page appears only in the center pane when empty—other panes show a standard empty state.

  To reopen the welcome page, close all items in the center pane or use the command palette to search for "Welcome".

- **Full-file brand pass**: Required: yes. Review the entire getting-started.md file to ensure all content meets the brand rubric (remove any "simply", "just", "easily" hedging; ensure second-person present tense throughout; verify all setting references follow the Settings Editor → JSON pattern).

- **Brand voice scorecard**:

  | Criterion            | Score | Notes |
  | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
  | Technical Grounding  | 4     | Factual description of welcome page behavior with technical precision |
  | Natural Syntax       | 5     | Clear, direct sentences without artificial phrasing |
  | Quiet Confidence     | 5     | States behavior without hedging or superlatives |
  | Developer Respect    | 5     | Treats reader as capable; no hand-holding language |
  | Information Priority | 4     | Leads with what matters (when welcome page appears), then details |
  | Specificity          | 5     | Concrete details: "center pane", "other panes show standard empty state" |
  | Voice Consistency    | 5     | Second person, present tense, matches established docs voice |
  | Earned Claims        | 5     | No unearned claims—purely descriptive |
  | **TOTAL**            | 38    | Passes threshold |

### Notes for Reviewer
The change is subtle but affects user expectations: users who split their workspace may notice the welcome page no longer appears in all empty panes. The documentation should clarify this behavior without making it seem like a limitation. If no "Welcome Page" section currently exists in getting-started.md, this content should be added in a logical location (likely after initial installation/launch information).
